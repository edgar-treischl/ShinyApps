### Shoe Size explain income?

As outlined, shoe size and peoples' income can be correlated, but why? The biological sex of a person determines how large feet become and men have on average a higher income (e.g. due to part time work) compared to women. Thus, the third variable *sex* is a common cause that effect both variables, shoe size and income. 

The scatter plot on the right side illustrates the shoe size - income confounding with simulated data. Depending on how strong sex is related with income (and shoe size), we may observe a substantial effect of shoe size on income. However, see what happens if we control for sex. In the scatter plot we split observations and give each sex a different color; or in terms of a multivariate analysis, we include sex in the analysis.
