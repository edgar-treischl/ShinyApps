### Simulated data

Did you know that shoe size explains peoples' income? I am kidding, the effect of shoe size and income is a well-known example for *a confounding variable*, because participants' sex explains the relationship. 

Before we explore this effect in more detail, let's have a look at the data. The app uses simulated data because it is much easier (and clearer!) to simulated data to learn more about causality. By simulating data, we determine the causal structure of variables. We define that X affects Y and not the other way around. On the right you can inspect a small part of the data. For example, we create 1000 observations with 50 percent male and 50 percent female participants. Next, we make an assumption about the distribution of the income variable (e.g. mean income, standard deviation). Ultimately, we give male person a higher income (and larger shoe sizes) to simulate data for a confounding variable.
